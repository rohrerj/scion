// Package bwencoding holds the encoding of the bandwidth of a Hummingbird
// reservation. The dataplane carries that bandwidth as a 10 bit codepoint, so
// everybody who reads or writes one has to agree on the bandwidth it stands
// for: the router that polices the traffic, and the marketplace that sells the
// reservations.

// EncodeBandwidth returns the bandwidth of a codepoint, in kbps.
//
// It is a variable so that a different encoding can be put in place, which every
// user of a codepoint then follows. Replace it during initialization, before any
// codepoint is interpreted.
